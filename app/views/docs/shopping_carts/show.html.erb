    <h3>Shopping Cart</h3>
    <p class='margin-sides-10'>
      The Shopping Cart is built a bit differently than many carts.  The cart serves as the cart history, the wish list, the items saved for later and a normal cart.  What this gives you is history.  So now if your marketing team wants to know more information about customers you can supply a more individualized marketing strategy.  The downside is the cart will grow with time.  It would be wise to archive the cart information for larger apps.
    </p>
    <p class='margin-sides-10'>
      When you go to checkout the order is created and uses the active cart items in the item_type == shopping_cart.  At this time users are required to log in.  The customer navigates through several small forms to complete the checkout.  This process was inspired by several major websites when creating a multiform checkout.  One large form allows users a greater chance to make a mistake.  Errors on forms are very frustrating so these small forms should keep your customers happy.  Adding an AB tests here to allow users to see different checkout processes will be a future project.
